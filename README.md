# Redfish Profile Simulator

## About

***Redfish Profile Simulator*** is a Python34 real simulator of the "simple monolithic server" feature profile.

* A simple, minimal Redfish Service
* For a monolithic Server
* Aligned with: OCP Remote Machine Management Spec feature set

### Description

* Based on flask
* Initial resources are loaded from a catfish mockup into python dictionary structures
    * After that, data is read/patched... to the dictionaries
* Supports BasicAuth, as well as Redfish Session Auth  (for one session, one user)
* Uses:
    * easy to add new URIs for testing a client
    * easy to tweak behavior or add bad responses to test a client
    * allows testing of authentication -- which current mockup servers dont do
    * easy to insert print statements in service to see if data coming across good..etc

### Current Limitation:

* supports a single user/passwd and token
* the user/passwd is:   root/password123456    
* The authToken for Session Auth is: 123456SESSIONauthcode
* Supports only HTTP  (not HTTPS)
* with redfishtool, use options: redfishtool.py -r127.0.0.1:5000 -u root -p password123456 -S Never <subcmd>

## Usage

* ` python redfishProfileSimulatorMain.py [options]`
* `[Options]`:

        -V,  --Version,--- the program version
        -h,  --help,   --- help
        -H<hostIP>,  --Host=<hostIp>   --- host IP address. dflt=127.0.0.1
        -P<port>,--Port=<port> --- the port to use. dflt=5000
        -p<profile_path>, --profile=<profile_path>   --- the path to the Redfish profile to use. dflt="SimpleOcpServerV1"
    
## Implementation

* The simulation includes an http server, RestEngine, and dynamic Redfish datamodel.
* You can GET, PATCH,... to the service just like a real Redfish service.
* Both Basic and Redfish Session/Token authentication are supported 
    * for a single user/passwd and token
    * the user/passwd is:   root/password123456    
    * The authToken for Session Auth is: 123456SESSIONauthcode
    * these can be changed by editing the redfishURSs.py file---will make dynamic later.
* The http service and Rest engine is built on Flask, and all code is Python 3.4+
* The data model resources are "initialized" from the SPMF "SimpleOcpServerV1" Mockup.
    * and stored as python dictionaries
    * then the dictionaries are updated with patches, posts, deletes.
* The program can be extended to support other mockup \"profiles\".
* By default, the simulation runs on localhost (127.0.0.1), on port 5000.
    * These can be changed with CLI options: -P<port> -H <hostIP>  | --port=<port> --host=<hostIp>

## Simple OCP Server V1 Mockup Description

* A Monolithic server:
    * One ComputerSystem
    * One Chassis
    * One Manager

* Provides basic management features aligned with OCP Remote Machine Management Spec 1.01:
    * Power-on/off/reset
    * Boot to PXE, HDD, BIOS setup (boot override)
    * 4 temp sensors per DCMI (CPU1, CPU2, Board, Inlet)
    * Simple Power Reading, and  DCMI Power Limiting
    * Fan Monitoring w/ redundancy
    * Set asset tag and Indicator LED
    * Basic inventory (serial#, model, SKU, Vendor, BIOS verâ€¦)
    * User Management
    * BMC management: get/set IP, version, enable/disable protocol

* What it does NOT have -- that the Redfish 1.0 model supports
    * No PSUs in model  (RMM spec did not include PSUs) 
    * No ProcessorInfo, MemoryInfo, StorageInfo, System-EthernetInterfaceInfo
    * No Tasks
    * JsonSchema and Registries collections left out (since that is optional)
    * No EventService--Remote Machine Management spec used basic PET alerts
    * Uses only the pre-defined privileges and roles

## TO DO

Some limitations to be extended in current implementation

* Auth supports a single hard-coded username, password, and AuthToken, although the protocol is 100% compliant with respect to testing clients trying to authenticate
    * ex with basic auth, you have to use the hard coded user/password
    * ex with Session Auth, you just use the hard coded AuthToken
* adding and deleting users not implemented--has 3 or 4 users predefined
* accountService properties can be written, but failed logins, lockouts, etc is not implemented
* system log not implemented yet
